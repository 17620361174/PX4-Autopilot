/**
 * @file arx_rls.hpp
 * @brief Efficient recursive weighted least-squares algorithm without matrix inversion
 *
 * Assumes an ARX (autoregressive) model:
 * A(q^-1)y(k) = q^-d * B(q^-1)u(k) + A(q^-1)e(k)
 *
 * with:
 * q^-i  backward shift operator
 * A(q^-1) = 1 + a_1*q^-1 +...+ a_n*q^-n
 * B(q^-1) = b_0 + b_1*q^-1...+ b_m*q^-m
 * n  order of A(q^-1)
 * m  order of B(q^-1)
 * d  delay
 * u  input of the system
 * y  output of the system
 * e  white noise input
 *
